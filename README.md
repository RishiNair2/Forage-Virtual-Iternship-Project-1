# Forage-Virtual-Iternship-Project-1

This project from forage was based on a fictional company from Australia called Sprocket Central Pty Ltd which is a medium size bikes & cycling accessories company. The company has a large dataset relating to its customers and transactions but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. They have also provided a new list of 1000 potential customers with their current datasets. The goal the company wants to establish is to reveal useful customer insights that could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing while ,also, focusing on high value customers to improve performance.

Some key questions we wanted to answer within the dataset were:
1. What are the trends in the underlying data?
2. Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
3. Where should resources be allocated to?

Main Datasets Analyzed:
- New Customer List
- Transactions
